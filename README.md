# PAM PAM Store

A simple, static e-commerce demo built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This project simulates a storefront where users can add products to a shopping cart, adjust quantities, and view a checkout modal (fake/demo only).

## 📁 Project Structure
```
index.html          # main page with product listings and cart
script.js           # handles product rendering, cart logic, and localStorage
style.css           # basic dark‑themed styling
Image/              # product images referenced in script.js
```

## 🚀 Features
- Display a list of products with images, names, and prices
- Add items to cart and persist state using `localStorage`
- Increase or decrease item quantities
- Cart item count displayed in header 🛒
- Calculate and display total cost
- Fake checkout modal for demonstration

## 🛠️ Setup & Usage
1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (no server needed).
3. Interact with the products and cart.

> The cart data is stored locally in the browser; clearing site data will reset it.

## 🧩 Customization
- Add or change products in `script.js`.
- Modify styles in `style.css` for a different theme or layout.
- Replace images in the `Image/` folder and update paths accordingly.
